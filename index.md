## Welcome to my personal corner of the Internet!

I'm John, an American masters student currently studying cognitive science at Universität Osnabrück in Germany.  My focus is on artificial intelligence and neuroinformatics, which basically means all I do everyday is machine learning, coding, and math!  You might have some questions:
- What am I currently working on? Check out this [link](_pages/projects.md)!
- Why am I studying such a field? See [here](#background).
- Why Germany? Look [here](#germany)!
- Can I see your resume/CV? Sure! Here's the [US CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/cvs/US-CV.pdf), and the [German CV]({{ site.baseurl }}//cvs/DE-CV.pdf)<sup>1</sup>. Note: there are currently different layouts because I am testing various styles.

### <a name="background"></a>My Background
I received my bachelors in psychology with a minor in behavioral neuroscience at Stockton University in 2014.  My goal was to go into neuroscience research, with the explicit research direction of applying neural insights to artificial intelligence.  After a round of PhD interviews, it turns out that most people focus their research the other way around (i.e. machine learning -> neuroscience research).  So I decided to go directly into machine learning and data science.  However, with a degree in psychology a direct transfer isn't a realistic expectation.  My best option was to study cognitive science...which turns out to be exactly the field that I wanted to do research in in the first place!  Funny how things work out, eh?

### <a name="germany"></a>Studying in Germany
Germany is quite an interesting place to study.  There's a very large international component to any English language program, and you make friends from all across the globe.  The Germans don't really do the "liberal arts" degree that is so popular in the States; that means that if you study physics, all you do is physics.  So for me, someone coming from psychology, it is the perfect setup to completely focus on an almost entirely new topic in order to learn everything possible within the time of my program.  Plus, one doesn't have to worry about massive student loans---all you pay (at least at public institutions) is the semester fee, which is just a couple hundred euros.  


<sup>1</sup>The only difference is that the German CV contains a picture, and no translations of the German words :smile:
