# Hackathon History
I've participated in a few hackathons.  Below are recollections of the events.  Listed in reverse chronological order.

### Hack4Health
Placed second with a chatbot named *Mercura*.  The idea was simple: we only know about how we feel ourselves, but doctors see many patients a day and have a good idea whether or not the cough you have right now is serious.  So through Mercura, we connect patients to the doctor's knowledge.  Throw in some diease prediction based on symptom counts in cities, and the doctors also have an extra source of information to make diagnoses.

### Münsterhack
Placed first with a two-pronged project.  The first part was prediction of bus delays many hours into the future, while the second was an augmented reality display to be shown at any bus stop in Münster.  This idea came about because some bus stops outside of the main areas don't have live displays, so it'd be great to be able to hold up your phone and instantly get that feedback we are familiar with.

### Collabothon
First hackathon I went to.  It was fintech themed, and took place in Frankfurt.  Since Germany is mainly still a "cash is king" country, we decied to use machine learning to try and predict where people spend their cash, so that they don't have to manually input it into budgeting apps.  The idea developed into an entire budgeting app on its own, called CashFlo.
