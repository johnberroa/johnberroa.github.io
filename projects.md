# Projects
Below is a list, a short description, and links if available, of my current projects.  Each project is marked with a [U] or a [P] tag, for "University" and "Personal" respectively.

## Current Projects

- [U] [Finger Counting Neural Network](https://github.com/johnberroa/Finger-Counting-Neural-Network): For the Comparative Machine Learning class, we used [some code](https://github.com/jgv7/CNN-HowManyFingers) from GitHub to count fingers for a [game we created](https://github.com/johnberroa/Duel-of-the-Numbers).  After a follow-up talk with the professor, I decided to take on the task of creating our own finger counting neural network, based on a more sophisticated architecture (ResNet).  Currently in the data collection and debugging stage.

- [P] [Perceptrons](https://github.com/johnberroa/Perceptrons): I'm currently creating my own implementations of perceptrons with the explicit focus of trying to understand how they work with clean code.  This includes an MLP (feedforward neural network) implementation which should be able to take in any vector of input and train on it at fairly good speeds (due to the matrix design).
