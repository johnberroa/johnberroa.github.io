# Projects
Below is a list, a short description, and links if available, of my current projects.  Each project is marked with a [U] or a [P] tag, for "University" and "Personal" respectively.

## Current Projects

- [U] [Nature Inspired Algorithms](https://github.com/johnberroa/Ant-Colony-Optimization): For the Nature Inspired Algorithms class, we need to create a conglomeration of algorithms inspired by nature (such as Ant Colony Optimization linked above, and Genetic Algorithms) to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem.  We are using a mix of both genetic algorithms and ACO in order to split the routes into smaller clusters, and find the most optimal routes within those clusters for the trucks.  What I found really interesting so far about the project is how much my coding has improved: at the beginning of the semester, when we learned ACO, my code took forever to run and had a lot of unnecessary lines.  I rewrote the algorithm for the final project, and increased its speed 20x!  I was quite surprised how far I've come in the past four months or so between implementations.

- [P] [Perceptrons](https://github.com/johnberroa/Perceptrons): I'm currently creating my own implementations of perceptrons with the explicit focus of trying to understand how they work with clean code.  This includes an MLP (feedforward neural network) implementation which should be able to take in any vector of input and train on it at fairly good speeds (due to the matrix design).
